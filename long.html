			  With a 4&ndash;1 decision after a special meeting Thursday, March 30, the Montgomery City Council terminated the contract with Police Chief John Schmidt.
			 <br><br>
			The meeting opened at 7 p.m. Several administrative items were approved for a Czech May Day Celebration before it was closed at 7:35 p.m. to discuss an investigation and employee performance for Schmidt.
			 <br><br>
			The council reopened the meeting at 8:20 p.m., and according to Open Meeting Laws, voted publicly to terminate Schmidt’s contract. Mayor John Grimm made the motion, which councilor Mick McGuire seconded.<br><br></p>

  <p class="long-text">attendance, perhaps in response to a Facebook post that has since been deleted. The post by “MontgomeryMN Concerncitizens,” told people of an attempt to remove Schmidt from his position, then suggested people attend the meeting to support Schmidt. Grimm deviated from the agenda and permitted people to briefly speak up at the meeting.
<br><br>
When they voted, Grimm called it a “very difficult situation” and acknowledged that Schmidt is a “good guy.”
 <br><br>
After the meeting adjourned, McGuire said the termination was effective immediately. 
<br><br>
Schmidt has been the police chief since May 6, 2000. Prior to that, he had worked full time for the Montgomery force since 1993. He began with the city in 1991 as a part-time officer.

  <p class="long-text">According to City Administrator Brian Heck, there had been other investigations on Schmidt from outside of the city.
<br><br>
“There’s not a whole lot I can disclose,” Heck said.
<br><br>
When asked if there had been any other disciplinary actions on Schmidt, Heck acknowledged, “There had been, yes.”
<br><br><br><br><br><br>
The administrator said he couldn’t provide information or dates on those investigations due to data privacy laws.
<br><br>
According to the Minnesota Statutes 13.43 Subd. 2 under public data, “The final disposition of any disciplinary action together with the specific reasons for the action and data documenting the </p>

 <div class="col">
  <p class="long-text">basis of the action...” is public. However, Heck declined to release that information because Schmidt can appeal the council’s decision.<br><br>
  Schmidt was put on administrative leave and told of the special meeting when Heck served him his notice in the afternoon of Monday, March 27.
<br><br>
Heck said the council has provided 15 business days to Schmidt to file an appeal. According to Mark Anfinson, attorney for the Minnesota Newspaper Association, if he doesn’t appeal at the end of the timeline, then the council’s decision becomes final and all documents relating to it become public.<br><br>

Heck and Grimm then met with Sheriff Tietz and Chief Deputy Brett Mason to see if the county could help on a contract basis, starting the day after Schmidt was placed on administrative leave. At their regular meeting on Tuesday, April 4, the county approved a three-month contract for the Le

Heck said he is not aware of any other investigations or performance issues with any of the Montgomery officers.<span id="ending">■</span>
